I don't understand what you mean :: You push against the boulder and it slides to the side
You are standing on a windswept plateau high in the mountains :: The hammer is now sitting on the floor
The branches overhead tremble as though moved by an unseen hand :: Okay, the door is open
There is a broken record player here :: You reach into the wall and push some of the debris away 
To the east, you see a faint glimmer of light :: The floor begins to rumble as if a giant machine lies beneath it
You cannot do that with a window :: You slide the bookshelf aside to reveal a hidden passageway
A massive troll bars your path :: The troll gurgles and falls to the ground
What do you want to unlock the box with :: With a grating squeal, the garage door swings closed
I don't know that word :: The passageway vanishes behind you
Sunlight glimmers brightly through the mist :: Suddenly, half of the embankment breaks free and tumbles into the river
The room is old and musty, with heavy upholstered furniture arranged near the fireplace :: You pull the lever
An insufferably perky secretary sits behind the desk manning the phones :: With a rushing sound of water, the river begins to rise
