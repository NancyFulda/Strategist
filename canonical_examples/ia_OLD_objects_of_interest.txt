A large boulder is sitting nearby :: A large, mist-shrouded mountain is visible to the east
A little bird flutters from branch to branch, singing a cheerful song :: You can hear birds chirping in the distance
Perhaps it's hungry :: A narrow path twines through the undergrowth to your left
Something sparkles among the rocks at the bottom of the river :: You lift the elvish sword from the mantlepiece
Acorns lie scattered along the ground :: The hammer is now lying on the ground 
Inside the glass cabinet is a jewel-encrusted egg :: The binoculars have been dropped
On the table you see: a bottle of water, a loaf of bread, a pair of chopsticks, a couple of pebbles, and an old, crumbling manuscript in a neatly-written hand :: Goggles: taken, spectacles: taken, boulder: it's too heavy to lift, pretty glass box: you're afraid it might break
There is a pair of spectacles here :: The forest is dense and impenetrable, overlapping roots and trees the size of giants
The troll stares at you with a baleful eye :: I wouldn't know how to do that with a troll
The dog continues to bark :: Your health is at 27/30
The little can looks at you mournfully :: A footbridge leads toward the castle in the north
You can't be serious :: If only there was some way to get past the guards
The wizard shouts and begins mumbling an incantation :: You can't see any wizard here
The room contains: a chair, a fireplace, a coat rack, and a floor lamp :: There is nothing interesting about the chair
Maybe you should look for something to read :: You read the newspaper
Maybe you should try talking to him :: Talk is cheap
There is a bucket of water here :: You pick up the bucket of water
A particularly large tree attracts your attention :: Large trees are dotted about the meadow
You notice that the floor is wet :: The swamp is wet and murky
You recall that giraffes like to eat alfalfa :: Giraffes like to eat alfalfa
Maybe if you ring the doorbell, someone will answer :: A pointles endeavor
