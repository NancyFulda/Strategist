With great effort, you push the window open :: Taken
You are standing on a windswept plateau high in the mountains :: Dropped
Flattery will get you nowhere :: The hammer is now sitting on the floor
An elvish sword is mounted to the wall :: You carefully lift the elvish sword from its place on the wall
There is a broken record player here :: You take the broken record player
The egg is bejeweled and looks valuable :: You reach into the nest and remove the bejeweled egg
To the east, you see a faint glimmer of light :: You pick up the dictionary
You cannot do that with a window :: You are now carrying the hammer
A massive troll bars your path :: You remove the troll's keys
What do you want to unlock the box with :: Can opener: dropped
The garage door opens with a loud squeal :: You put down the axe
I don't know that word :: Working quickly, you gather as many of the pebbles as you can
