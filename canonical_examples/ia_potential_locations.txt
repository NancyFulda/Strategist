You can't do that with a rock :: There is a large mountain to the north
You see a small rock sitting near the center of the fountain :: There are exits to the west and south
I don't know what that word means :: To the west, a small trail winds into the forest 
There is a pile of leaves here :: A shadowed, drafty staircaise leads up to the next level
What do you want to kill the troll with :: The archway is massive but inviting, almost as if the flowers are beckoning you to walk through it
In the distance, a flash of lightning lights the sky :: You wonder whether you dare use the ladder, which is missing several rungs
You are standing inside a small thatched cottage :: A rocky trail leads along the cliff
You are now carrying the lantern :: The door is red with a blue knocker
You are carrying: A small lantern. :: pathways lead to the east and north
You are likely to be eaten by a grue :: You can go left into the kitchen or continue straight along the hallway
You are standing in front of a white house :: A small road leads toward the caslte
Taken :: A ladder leads down into the pit
You can't be serious :: To the north, you see a small footbridge spanning the river
The door is firmly locked :: The terrace doors swing open invitingly
You tug at the heavy rusted gates, but they refuse to open :: There is a garden to the east and a small gatehouse to the north
The footbridge is too old and rickety to use :: A badly overgrown trail leads to the southeast
