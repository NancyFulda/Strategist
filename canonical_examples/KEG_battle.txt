You are in danger :: Your health is 2/17
The storekeeper looks at you expectantly :: You are badly wounded
You are standing on a windswept plateau high in the mountains :: A massive troll bars your path
If you fall from this height, you will die :: The bull paws the ground with its hoof, then charges toward you
You enter the shop, prepared to barter :: The deadly spider advances, ready to attack
An elvish sword is mounted on the wall :: The soldiers advance with raised swords
Your heart thumps in your chest :: The king's sword pierces your shoulder
Sally offers to give you an apple for her locket :: An angry god of destruction swirls overhead
There is a pile of leaves on the ground :: The hawk shrieks and claws at you with its talons
You are beginning to lose consciousness :: The dog growls and bares its fangs
