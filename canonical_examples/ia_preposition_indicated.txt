You can't do that with a rock :: What do you want to kill the troll with
An elvish sword is mounted to the wall :: You need something sharp to cut the rope with
I don't know the word 'defenestrate' :: Perhaps you should put the book on the shelf
I don't know what that word means :: What do you want to light the lantern with
Taken :: Perhaps you need a lever
You can't go that way :: Where do you want to take the cat
You are now carrying the lantern :: Who do you want to give the spectacles to
North of white house :: What do you want to cook the mutton with
You can't see how to do that with an axe :: What do you want to attack with: the sword or the knife
What an idea :: You need a light
There does not seem to be any way to do that :: You must light the lantern first
A sloping path leads northward into the darkness :: The door is firmly locked
To the east, you see a light glimmering through the trees :: You tug at the edge of the window, but it won't open
Now is not the time for piety :: The box creaks slightly, but you are not strong enough to open it on your own
To the west is a door :: If only you could find the key
The tunnel entrance is blocked by a large boulder :: What do you want to give the wizard: the candle or the wand
