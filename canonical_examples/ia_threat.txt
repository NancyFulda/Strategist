You are standing on a windswept plateau high in the mountains :: You are in danger
An elvish sword is mounted to the wall :: Your health is 2/17
To the east you see a small garden with attractive flowers :: You are badly wounded
There is a pile of leaves here :: The deadly spider advances, ready to attack
What do you want to kill the troll with :: The soldiers advance with raised swords
The egg is bejeweled and looks valuable :: If you fall from this height, you will die
Taken :: The bull paws the ground with its hoof, then charges toward you
You can't go that way :: Your heart thumps in your chest
The southeast window is slightly ajar :: You are beginning to lose consciousness
A cute puppy is standing on the path :: A massive troll bars your path
You must be joking :: The dog growls and bares its fangs
North of White House :: The hawk shrieks and claws at your eyes with its talons
You can't see how to do that with an axe :: You've lost an awful lot of blood
You can't carry any more items :: If you fall from this height, you will die
LIVING ROOM :: The barbarian raises his axe and shouts in an unfamiliar language
What an idea :: An angry god of destruction swirls overhead
Given the complexity of the puzzle, you are surprised to see that the box is lying half-open :: You are badly wounded
That does not seem wise :: You are dizzy and the world swims before your eyes
I do not know the word 'purify' :: The dragon charges at you breathing fire
You can't see any songbird here :: The king's sword pierces your shoulder
I don't know the word 'defenestrate' :: You are plummeting to your death, with only a few seconds left before you strike the ground
