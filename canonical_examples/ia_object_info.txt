Overhead, a pair of fluffy clouds float by :: You are now carrying the magical ocarina
A large boulder is sitting nearby :: A large, mist-shrouded mountain is visible to the east
A little bird flutters from branch to branch, singing a cheerful song :: A narrow path twines through the undergrowth to your left
Something sparkles among the rocks at the bottom of the river :: You lift the elvish sword from the mantlepiece
Acorns lie scattered along the ground :: The hammer is now lying on the ground
Inside the glass cabinet is a jewel-encrusted egg :: The binoculars have been dropped
On the table you see: a bottle of water, a loaf of bread, a pair of chopsticks, a couple of pebbles, and an old, crumbling manuscript in a neatly-written hand :: Goggles: taken, spectacles: taken, boulder: it's too heavy to lift, pretty glass box: you're afraid it might break
There is a pair of spectacles here :: The forest is dense and impenetrable, overlapping roots and trees the size of giants
A single butterfly flutters on the breeze :: I wouldn't know how to do that with a troll
The troll stares at you with a baleful eye :: You can't be serious
The dog continues to bark :: Your health is at 27/30
