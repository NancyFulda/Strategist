You are standing on a windswept plateau high in the mountains :: You can't do that with a rock
An elvish sword is mounted to the wall :: I don't know what that word means
To the east you see a small garden with attractive flowers :: I don't know the word 'defenestrate'
There is a pile of leaves here :: What do you want to kill the troll with
The egg is bejeweled and looks valuable :: Taken
A pile of books are spread across the table :: You can't go that way
The southeast window is slightly ajar :: You are now carrying the lantern
A massive troll bars your path :: You must be joking
You are in an ornate entry hall with plush carpet and stained glass windows :: You can't see any angels here
North of White House :: You can't see how to do that with an axe
SUNNY MEADOW :: You can't carry any more items
Living Room :: What an idea
Given the complexity of the puzzle, you are surprised to see that the box is lying half-open :: That does not seem wise
PASSAGEWAY :: The mountains are impassible
Rocky Ledge :: There does not seem to be any way to do that
A sloping path leads northward into the darkness :: You have scored a point
To the east, you see a light glimmering through the trees :: You can't go any farther east
The scattered remains of yesterday's dinner lie strewn across the floor :: Now is not the time for piety
To the west is a door :: The door is firmly locked
A tunnel leads away to the south :: The tunnel entrance is blocked by a large boulder
