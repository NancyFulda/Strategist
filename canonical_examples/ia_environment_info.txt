A large boulder lies nearby :: Overhead, a pair of fluffy clouds float past 
A large, mist-shrouded mountain is visible to the east :: A sudden gust of wind rushes through the hall, fluttering the candles
A narrow path twines through the undergrowth to your left :: An earthquake rumbles in the distance
You lift the elvish sword from the mantlepiece :: A flash of lightning breaks across the sky
The hammer is now lying on the ground :: In the distance you hear the chirping of a bird
Taken :: The king frowns and scratches his nose 
The forest is dense and impenetrable, overlapping roots and trees the size of giants :: Sounds of excitement emanate from the market, and a pair of children runs past, laughing
You can't be serious :: The sky begins to get light
Your health is at 27/30 :: Stars glimmer overhead, beautiful but menacing
