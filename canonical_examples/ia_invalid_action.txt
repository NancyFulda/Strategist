You are standing on a windswept plateau high in the mountains :: You can't do that with a rock
What do you want to kill the troll with? :: I don't know what that word means
To the east you see a small garden with attractive flowers :: I don't know the word 'defenestrate'
There is a pile of leaves here :: You must be joking
Taken :: A futile attempt
A pile of books are spread across the table :: You can't go that way
You are now carrying the lantern :: You cannot get the lantern
A massive troll bars your path :: You're not making any sense
Dropped :: You can't see any angels here
SUNNY MEADOW :: You can't see how to do that with an axe
Living Room :: What an idea
You need something to pry the bolt loose with :: That does not seem wise
The mountains are impassible :: There does not seem to be any way to do that
You have scored a point :: What good would that do
The door is firmly locked :: You can't go any farther east
The tunnel entrance is blocked by a large boulder :: There is no way to enter the tunnel
