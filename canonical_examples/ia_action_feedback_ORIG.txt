There is a large mountain to the north. :: You can't do that with a rock.
You see a small rock sitting near the center of the fountain. :: I don't know what that word means.
To the west, a small trail winds into the forest. :: I don't know the word 'defenestrate'.
There is a pile of leaves here. :: What do you want to kill the troll with?
In the distance, a flash of lightning lights the sky. :: Taken.
You are standing inside a small thatched cottage. :: You can't go that way.
Your old nemesis, Dr. Evil Crankenshod, laughs at you condescendingly. :: You are now carrying the lantern.
You are carrying: A small lantern. :: You must be joking.
A pack of matches. :: You can't see any angels here.
You feel your consciousness slipping away. :: You can't see how to do that with an axe.
You are likely to be eaten by a grue. :: You can't carry any more items.
