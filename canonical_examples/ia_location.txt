You can't do that with a rock :: You are standing on a windswept plateau high in the mountains
I don't know what that word means :: An elvish sword is mounted to the wall
I don't know the word 'defenestrate' :: To the east you see a small garden with attractive flowers
What do you want to kill the troll with :: There is a pile of leaves here
Taken :: The egg is bejeweled and looks valuable
You can't go that way :: A pile of books are spread across the table
You are now carrying the lantern :: The southeast window is slightly ajar
You must be joking :: A massive troll bars your path
You can't see any angels here :: You are in an ornate entry hall with plush carpet and stained glass windows
You can't see how to do that with an axe :: North of White House
You can't carry any more items :: SUNNY MEADOW
What an idea :: Living Room
That does not seem wise :: Given the complexity of the puzzle, you are surprised to see that the box is lying half-open
The mountains are impassible :: PASSAGEWAY
There does not seem to be any way to do that :: Rocky Ledge
You have scored a point :: A sloping path leads northward into the darkness
You can't go any farther east :: To the east, you see a light glimmering through the trees
Now is not the time for piety :: The scattered remains of yesterday's dinner lie strewn across the floor
The door is firmly locked :: To the west is a door
The tunnel entrance is blocked by a large boulder :: A tunnel leads away to the south
You see nothing interesting about the chair :: An old chair stands in the middle of the room
A pointless endeavor :: Maybe if you ring the doorbell, someone will answer
You are empty-handed :: The palace entrance is guarded by soldiers
You are carrying nothing :: A sheer cliff rises before you, reaching toward the sky
You have scored 12 points, out of a possible 400 :: A little stream runs past the front of the barn
Score: 5 :: If only you could find a way to enter the skyscraper, you might be able to return the key
You can't move the small mailbox :: There is a small mailbox here
The door is firmly locked :: The dining room is accessible through a small door, which is locked
You don't have a crowbar :: A crowbar lies on the ground to your right
The boulder will not budge :: A massive boulder prevents further travel
